# Trading Strategy Simulation with RSI Expert Advisor

This repository contains MQL5 code for simulating and testing a trading strategy using the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicator. The strategy is implemented in an Expert Advisor (EA) that utilizes classes for simulation and trading logic.

## Introduction

The project consists of three primary MQL5 files:

1. **Simulate.mqh**: Contains the `Simulate` class, which is used for simulating trading operations and tracking performance metrics.

2. **SimulateRSI.mqh**: Extends the `Simulate` class and implements a trading strategy based on the RSI indicator and moving averages.

3. **RsiEA.mq5**: The main Expert Advisor (EA) that uses the `SimulateRSI` class to simulate and test the RSI-based trading strategy.

## Usage
1. **Copy Files**: Copy the `Simulate.mqh`, `SimulateRSI.mqh`, `RsiEA.mq5` files into the "Experts" directory of your MetaTrader terminal.

2. **Compile**: Compile the `RsiEA.mq5` script using the MetaEditor.

3. **Run the EA**: Drag and drop the compiled EA (`RsiEA.ex5`) onto a chart in MetaTrader. Ensure that automated trading is enabled.

4. **Adjust Parameters**: Modify the EA parameters to fit your trading preferences. Refer to the *Parameters* section for details.

## Parameters
The `RsiEA.mq5` script includes various parameters that can be adjusted to customize the trading strategy. Here are the key parameters:

- **Magic Number**: Unique identifier for the EA's trades.
- **Lot Size**: The size of each trading position.
- **Stop Loss and Take Profit**: Values for setting stop loss and take profit levels.
Applied Price: The price used in calculations (e.g., close, high, low, open).
- **RSI Parameters**: Ratio, Narrow, Hour, Shift for RSI calculation.
- **MA Parameters**: Period for Moving Average calculation.

## Testing and Optimization
To test and optimize the trading strategy, follow these steps:

1. **Backtesting**: Conduct backtesting in MetaTrader using historical data to evaluate the strategy's performance.

2. **Optimization**: Adjust parameters to find the optimal set for maximizing profits or minimizing losses.

3. **Forward Testing**: Implement the strategy in a demo account or with small live trades to observe real-time performance.
